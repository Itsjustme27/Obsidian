- The UKC states that there are 18 phases to an attack: Everything from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and understanding an attacker's motive. These phases have been grouped together in this room into a few areas of focus for brevity, which will be detailed in the remaining tasks.

- Some large benefits of the UKC over traditional cybersecurity kill chain frameworks include the fact that it is modern and extremely detailed (reminder: it has 18 phases officially, whereas other frameworks may have a small handful)

| Modern (released in 2017, updated in 2022).                                                                                                                                                           | Some frameworks, such as MITRE’s were released in 2013, when the cybersecurity landscape was very different.                      |
| The UKC is extremely detailed (18 phases).                                                                                                                                                            | Other frameworks often have a small handful of phases.                                                                            |
| The UKC covers an entire attack - from reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation and includes identifying an attacker's motivation.                                                             | Other frameworks cover a limited amount of phases.                                                                                |
| The UKC highlights a much more realistic attack scenario. Various stages will often re-occur. For example, after exploiting a machine, an attacker will begin reconnaissance to pivot another system. | Other frameworks do not account for the fact that an attacker will go back and forth between the various phases during an attack. |
