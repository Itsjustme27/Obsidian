-  **Attack lifecycle**:

	![[Pasted image 20251229152809.png]]

	1. **Reconnaissance:**
		Scanning the environment for potential vulnerabilities or harvesting info from social media.

	2. **Weaponization**:
		Pairing malicious code with an exploit to create a weapon.

	3. **Delivery:**
		Delivering the weapon/malware to the target (e.g. via email, USB, website, etc.)

	4. **Exploitation**:
		The delivered malware is triggered upon user interaction. It exploits the vulnerability.

	5. **Installation**:
		The weapon install malware on the system.

	6. **Command and Control**:
		A command channel for remote manipulation of the victim.

	7. **Action on objectives**:
		With hands-on access the attacker can achieve their objective.


-  **Mapping alerts to ATT&CK:**

	1. **Initial Access (TA0001):**
		- Represents how the attacker first gains access or compromises your environment.
		- Example Alert:
			“Repeated failed authentication attempts followed by a successful login from IP 185.220.X.X”. Mapping T1078 (Valid Accounts) Attackers using compromised credentials.

	2. **Execution (TA0002)**:
		- Execution shows how adversaries run malicious code.
		- Example:
			Windows Events ID 4688 (Process creation) showing cmd.exe spawning powershell.exe with encoded commands, or scheduled tasks executed at suspicious times.

	3. **Persistence (TA0003)**:
		- Allows attackers to maintain access across reboots and credential changes.
		- Common artifacts:
			Registry Run Keys, scheduled tasks, WMI event subscriptions, service creation, or DLL sideloading configurations. Your EDR must alert to modifications to  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run or new services installed outside maintenance windows.

	4. **Privilege Escalation (TA0004):**
		- Attackers exploit misconfigurations, vulnerable drivers, or legitimate Windows features to gain elevated access.
		- Detection Focus:
			Look for processes requesting uncommon privileges, indicators of exploitation tools (such as PsExec, Mimikatz), or unusual parent-child process relationships in which low-privilege processes spawn elevated children.

	5. **Lateral Movement (TA0008)**:
		- The attackers move deeper into the network, e.g. from one compromised system to another.
		- Investigation Pattern:
			Spot authentication logs from the same compromised account accessing multiple systems in quick succession. Often with SYSTEM or administrative processes spawning from remote procedures.


**Another way to map the alerts to MITRE ATT&CK is DETT&CK**:

### DETT&ACK Framework

- **DETT&CK** stands for DEtect, Tactics, Techniques & Combat Threats.
- The purpose of DeTT&CT is to assist blue teams using MITRE ATT&CK to score and compare data log source quality, visibility coverage and detection coverage.

- How does it work?

	- Uses YAML file (simple text files) to keep track of our security status.

| Pillar           | What it tracks                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Sources** | List of all your logs (e.g., Windows Logs, Firewall, Antivirus). It scores their quality from 0 to 5. |
| **Visibility**   | Shows if you have the _potential_ to see an attack based on the logs you have.                        |
| **Detection**    | Shows if you actually have an _alert_ or "rule" set up to catch the bad guy.                          |
| **Groups**       | Compares your defense against specific hacker groups (e.g., "Can we stop APT29?").                    |
