The information security framework provides a comprehensive set of documents that outline the organisation's approach to information security and governs how security is implemented, managed, and enforced within the organisation. This mainly includes:

- **Policies**: A formal statement that outlines an organisation's goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives.

- **Standards**: A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service.

- **Guidelines**: A document that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objectives.

- **Procedures**: Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process.

- **Baselines**: A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet.

### Developing Governance Documents

Here are some generalised steps used to develop policies, standards, guidelines, etc.![how to develop governance documents](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/957df3acd08e9884b95a28e72bd7219a.png)

- **Identify the scope and purpose**:  Determine what the document will cover and why it is needed. For example, a password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords. In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems.

- **Research and review**: Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive and up-to-date. Review existing policies, procedures, and other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance.

- **Draft the document**: Develop an outline and start drafting the document, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and baselines. Ensure the document is specific, actionable, and aligned with the organisation's goals and values.

- **Review and approval**: Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management. Incorporate their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organisational goals and values. Obtain final approval from appropriate stakeholders.

- **Implementation and communication**: Communicate the document to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing it. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood and followed.

- **Review and update**: Periodically review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and practical. Monitor compliance and adjust the document based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.

### Explanation through Real-world Scenarios

We will go through some real-world scenarios to fully understand the steps to develop these documents.

#### Preparing a Password Policy

- **Define password requirements**: Minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
- **Define password usage guidelines**: Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords.
- **Define password storage and transmission guidelines**: Using encryption for password storage and requiring secure connections for password transmission.
- **Define password change and reset guidelines**: How often passwords should be changed etc. 
- **Communicate the policy**: Communicate the password policy to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure that they understand the requirements and guidelines. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure that employees follow the policy.
- **Monitor compliance**: Monitor compliance with the password policy and adjust the policy as needed based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.

### Making an Incident Response Procedure

- **Define incident types**: Unauthorised access, malware infections, or data breaches.

- **Define incident response roles and responsibilities**: Identify the stakeholders,  such as incident response team members, IT personnel, legal and compliance teams, and senior management.

- **Detailed Steps**: Develop step-by-step procedures for responding to each type of incident,  including initial response steps, such as containing the incident and preserving evidence; analysis and investigation steps, such as identifying the root cause and assessing the impact; response and recovery steps, such as mitigating the incident, reporting and restoring normal operations.

- **Report** the incident to management and document the incident response process for future reference. 

- **Communicate** the incident response procedures.

- **Review** and update the incident response procedures.

Organisations only sometimes need to make a standard, frameworks, or baselines; instead, they follow and use already made documents related to their field or discipline, as the financial sector may follow PCI-DSS and GLBA; healthcare may follow HIPPA, etc. There are numerous factors upon which we decide which standard framework of baseline checklist should be used; these include regulatory requirements primarily related to the particular geographical areas, scope, objectives, available resources, and many more.
