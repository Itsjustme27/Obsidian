The **N**map **S**cripting **E**ngine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful addition to Nmap, extending its functionality quite considerably. NSE Scripts are written in the _Lua_ programming language, and can be used to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaisance, however, it is well worth bearing in mind how extensive the script library is.

There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:

- `safe`:- Won't affect the target
- `intrusive`:- Not safe: likely to affect the target  
    
- `vuln`:- Scan for vulnerabilities
- `exploit`:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
- `auth`:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
- `brute`:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
- `discovery`:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).

A more exhaustive list can be found [here](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html).

In the next task we'll look at how to interact with the NSE and make use of the scripts in these categories.
