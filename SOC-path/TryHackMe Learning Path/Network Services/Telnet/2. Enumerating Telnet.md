**Enumeration**

We've already seen how key enumeration can be in exploiting a misconfigured network service. However, vulnerabilities that could be potentially trivial to exploit don't always jump out at us. For that reason, especially when it comes to enumerating network services, we need to be thorough in our method.

**Port Scanning**

Let's start out the same way we usually do, a port scan, to find out as much information as we can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine. Scan the machine with nmap.

### Write-up

1) Performed  a nmap scan: 

```shell
nmap -sS -sV -A 10.10.73.26
```

output:

```shell
TRACEROUTE (using port 80/tcp)
HOP RTT       ADDRESS
1   176.60 ms 10.21.0.1
2   177.11 ms 10.10.73.26
```

2) again tried for another scan:

```shell
nmap -vv -p 5000-9000 -T2 10.10.73.26
```


output:

```shell
Nmap scan report for 10.10.73.26
Host is up, received echo-reply ttl 63 (0.23s latency).
Scanned at 2024-12-28 03:23:12 EST for 445s
Not shown: 4000 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON
8012/tcp open  unknown syn-ack ttl 63

Read data files from: /usr/share/nmap
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 446.27 seconds
           Raw packets sent: 4906 (215.848KB) | Rcvd: 4003 (160.112KB)

```


3) It seems like there is only one open port.

4) Tried to connect to the port using telnet.

```shell
export ip=10.10.73.26
telnet $ip 8012
```

output:
```shell
Trying 10.10.73.26...
Connected to 10.10.73.26.
Escape character is '^]'.
SKIDY'S BACKDOOR. Type .HELP to view 
```

5) Found the username SKIDY and the technique backdoor.

Answer the questions below

1) How many **ports** are open on the target machine.

```Answer
1
```

2) What port is this? 

```Answer
8012
```

3) This port is unassigned, but still lists the **protocol** it's using, what protocol is this?

```Answer
tcp
```

4) Now re-run the **nmap** scan, without the **-p-** tag, how many ports show up as open?

```Answer
0
```

5) Based on the title returned to us, what do we think this port could be **used for**?

```Answer
a backdoor
```

6) Who could it belong to? Gathering possible **usernames** is an important step in enumeration.

```Answer
Skidy
```
