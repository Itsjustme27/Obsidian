# Lab: Reflected XSS with some SVG markup allowed

This lab has a simple reflected XSS vulnerability. The site is blocking common tags but misses some SVG tags and events.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert()` function.


# Writeup

1. Inject a standard XSS payload, such as:
    
    `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`
2. Observe that this payload gets blocked. In the next few steps, we'll use Burp Intruder to test which tags and attributes are being blocked.
3. Open Burp's browser and use the search function in the lab. Send the resulting request to Burp Intruder.
4. In the request template, replace the value of the search term with: `<>`
5. Place the cursor between the angle brackets and click **Add §** to create a payload position. The value of the search term should now be: `<§§>`
6. Visit the [XSS cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) and click **Copy tags to clipboard**.
7. In Burp Intruder, in the **Payloads** side panel, click **Paste** to paste the list of tags into the payloads list. Click **Start attack**.
8. When the attack is finished, review the results. Observe that all payloads caused a `400` response, except for the ones using the `<svg>`, `<animatetransform>`, `<title>`, and `<image>` tags, which received a `200` response.
9. Go back to the **Intruder** tab and replace your search term with:
    
    `<svg><animatetransform%20=1>`
10. Place the cursor before the `=` character and click **Add §** to create a payload position. The value of the search term should now be:
    
    `<svg><animatetransform%20§§=1>`
11. Visit the [XSS cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) and click **Copy events to clipboard**.
12. In Burp Intruder, in the **Payloads** side panel, click **Clear** to remove the previous payloads. Then click **Paste** to paste the list of attributes into the payloads list. Click **Start attack**.
13. When the attack is finished, review the results. Note that all payloads caused a `400` response, except for the `onbegin` payload, which caused a `200` response.
