# Lab: Reflected XSS with AngularJS sandbox escape without strings

This lab uses AngularJS in an unusual way where the `$eval` function is not available and you will be unable to use any strings in AngularJS.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that escapes the sandbox and executes the `alert` function without using the `$eval` function.
