# Lab: DOM XSS in `innerHTML` sink using source `location.search`

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. It uses an `innerHTML` assignment, which changes the HTML contents of a `div` element, using data from `location.search`.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert` function.
