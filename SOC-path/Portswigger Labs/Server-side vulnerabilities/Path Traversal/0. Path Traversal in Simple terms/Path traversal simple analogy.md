### **Path Traversal Vulnerability in Simple Terms**

Imagine you're running a **library**. Inside the library, you have a **Bookshelf** (the `BASE_DIRECTORY`) where all the books are kept.

Now, visitors (users) come to you and ask for a specific book (file). They hand you a piece of paper (`userInput`) with the name of the book they want.

Some visitors are sneaky. Instead of asking for a book from your **Bookshelf**, they write tricky instructions like:

- "Go out of the library, enter the manager's office, and open their secret drawer." (This is like `../../../secret-file` in path traversal attacks.)

You **must stop these tricks**, or people will access things they shouldn't!

### **How to Prevent This**

Here’s how you make sure people only get books from your Bookshelf:

1. **Step 1: Validate Their Request (Whitelist Check)**  
    First, check if their request is for a valid book name, like "Book1" or "Book2."
    - If someone writes "weirdbook.txt" or something strange like "leave_library/enter_secret_room.txt," reject it.
    - Think of this as **only allowing valid requests** from a list of trusted options.

---

2. **Step 2: Check the Real Location (Canonical Path Check)**  
    Even if the user asks for "Book1," **you don’t trust them just yet**.
    - You **follow their instructions carefully** to see where they really lead.
    - If their request leads to the actual Bookshelf, great! But if it leads somewhere outside the library (like the manager's office), reject it.
    - This is done using the **canonical path**—it shows the actual destination, no matter how the request was written.

---

### **What the Code Does**

1. The code creates a path by combining the **Bookshelf (BASE_DIRECTORY)** with the visitor's request (`userInput`).
    
    - Example: If the BASE_DIRECTORY is `/library/bookshelf` and `userInput` is `book1.txt`, the path becomes `/library/bookshelf/book1.txt`.
2. Then it checks the **real path** of the combined request (`file.getCanonicalPath()`).
    
    - If the real path still starts with `/library/bookshelf`, the request is safe.
    - If the real path goes somewhere else (e.g., `/manager/secret`), the code blocks it.

### **Why It's Important**

Without this check, a sneaky user could write instructions to steal secret files instead of books.  
For example:

- `../../../manager_secret_files/important.txt`  
    This would let them "traverse" outside the bookshelf to restricted areas!

---

### **Key Points**

- **BASE_DIRECTORY:** A safe folder (like your bookshelf).
- **userInput:** What the visitor is asking for (could be sneaky).
- **Canonical Path Check:** Ensures that no matter what the visitor asks for, they can't "escape" the safe folder.
