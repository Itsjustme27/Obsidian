# Project Plan: Web-Based DVWA with AI Security & Space Cyber Lab 🚀
## 🔥 Vision

A cutting-edge **web-based DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** that blends:

- OWASP Top 10 exploitation
    
- AI Security Testing
    
- Hidden CTF-style challenges
    
- A futuristic **Space Cybersecurity Lab** simulation
    

All wrapped up in a **self-contained Docker environment** for local testing and safety.

## 🎯 Core Features

### 1️⃣ OWASP Top 10 Exploitable Lab

- Simulate all **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities.
    
- Each flaw has a **flag** hidden inside.
    
- Capture a flag = earn points + learning content.
    
- **Scoreboard system** to track user progress.
    

### 2️⃣ Hidden Flags System + Easter Egg

- **Number of flags is hidden.**
    
- Users must work hard, or smartly uncover how many there are.
    
- Once **all standard flags are captured**, a success message appears:
    
    > ✅ _“You’ve captured all the flags!”_  
    > 🔐 _“Do you know a secret?”_ (**Encrypted hint**)
    
- This message teases a **secret bonus flag**.
    
- Players can **trigger the message again** if they miss copying the encrypted hint.
    

### 3️⃣ AI Security Challenges

- Embed a **vulnerable chatbot** or AI component.
    
- Users can test:
    
    - **Prompt Injection**
        
    - **Model Manipulation**
        
    - **Adversarial Attacks**
        
- Each AI challenge includes:
    
    - Explanation of the vulnerability
        
    - Secure mitigation strategies
        

### 4️⃣ Learning Hub Unlocks

- After capturing a flag, users unlock:
    
    - 🛠️ Why the vulnerability exists
        
    - 💻 The **actual vulnerable code snippet**
        
    - ✅ A **secure coding alternative**
        
    - 📘 Glossary of key security terms
        

### 5️⃣ 🛰️ Space Cybersecurity Lab (WIP Teaser)

- Preview section for future expansion:
    
    - Simulations of **satellite hacking scenarios**
        
    - Security issues in **GNSS spoofing**, **DTN**, etc.
        
- Will include hands-on future labs for:
    
    - Satellite communication security
        
    - Delay-tolerant networking attacks
        
    - Jamming/spoofing simulations

## 📦 Challenges Faced (And Overcome!)

### 🔐 Security Concerns

- Hosting a DVWA-like web app online is dangerous.
    
- Solution: **Containerize the whole lab using Docker** to keep everything local and isolated.
    

### 🧪 Docker Benefits

- Sets up the web server & environment automatically.
    
- Safe for users to test locally without external exposure.
    
- Great for reproducibility, education, and offline use.

## 🌱 Future Goals

- 🛠️ **Open-source** the project for the security community.
    
- 🧠 Collaborate with researchers in AI + space cybersecurity.
    
- 🧾 Submit this to conferences like **DEF CON, UbuCon**, etc.
    
- 🎮 Expand to include **gamified satellite security labs**.
