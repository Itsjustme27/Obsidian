### **Security Assessment Report for motif.com.np**
#### **1. Directory Listing Vulnerabilities**

- **Issue:** Certain directories on the server have directory listing enabled. This can expose file structures, filenames, and potentially sensitive content such as backups, configuration files, or other internal resources that should remain private.
    - **Exposed Directories:**
        - `/wp-content/plugins/`
        - `/wp-content/themes/`
        - `/wp-content/uploads/2024/`, `/wp-content/uploads/2025/`
- **Potential Risks:**
    - **File Exposure:** Attackers can enumerate files within these directories, which might include backup files, configuration files (like `wp-config.php`), or log files.
    - **Increased Attack Surface:** If attackers know which plugins or themes are in use, they may attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in these components.
    - **Path Traversal:** Misconfigured directory permissions could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive files outside of the expected directory structure.
- **Recommendation:**
    - **Disable Directory Listing:** Ensure that directory listing is disabled on the server through the web server configuration (`Options -Indexes` in Apache or `auto_index off` in Nginx).
    - **Access Control:** Set appropriate file and directory permissions to limit access to sensitive files.

#### **2. wp-admin/admin-ajax.php**

- **Issue:** The `admin-ajax.php` script in WordPress is exposed to the public and may allow unauthenticated users to perform certain actions that should be restricted to logged-in administrators.
- **Potential Exploitation:**
    - **Unauthenticated Access:** Malicious users could potentially exploit AJAX actions to interact with the admin backend, potentially triggering a chain of events leading to privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, or execution of administrative functions.
- **Recommendation:**
    - **Validate Permissions:** Ensure that AJAX requests verify the user's permissions before performing any sensitive actions.
    - **Limit Public Exposure:** Where possible, restrict access to `admin-ajax.php` using additional access controls or restrict certain endpoints to logged-in users only.
    - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks targeting the endpoint.

#### **3. wp-content/plugins, wp-content/themes, wp-content/uploads (2024, 2025)**

- **Issue:** The exposure of plugin and theme directories, along with user-uploaded content, can lead to multiple attack vectors.
    - **Vulnerabilities:**
        - **Outdated Plugins:** Attackers can enumerate the plugins and themes being used and search for known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
        - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the upload directories allow executable files (such as PHP scripts), malicious files could be uploaded and executed, leading to RCE vulnerabilities.
        - **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Publicly accessible upload directories may contain sensitive user data or malicious files uploaded by attackers.
- **Recommendation:**
    - **Perform Regular Vulnerability Scans:** Use tools like `wpscan` to keep plugins and themes up to date and identify potential vulnerabilities.
    - **Secure Uploads Directory:** Use proper file type validation for uploads, and ensure that files are not executable (e.g., disabling PHP execution in the uploads folder).
    - **Update Plugins/Software Regularly:** Regularly check for updates to WordPress plugins, themes, and core, and immediately patch known vulnerabilities.

---

#### **4. Outdated jQuery Versions (wp-include/js/dist)**

- **Issue:** The website uses outdated versions of jQuery (3.4.1 and 3.7.1), which may expose the site to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and vulnerabilities like prototype pollution.
    - **Potential Exploitation:**
        - **XSS Vulnerabilities:** Certain jQuery versions (like 3.4.1) have known exploits where attackers can bypass Content Security Policies (CSP) and inject malicious scripts.
        - **DOM-based XSS:** Prototype pollution vulnerabilities could allow attackers to tamper with the DOM and introduce malicious scripts.
- **Recommendation:**
    - **Upgrade jQuery:** Immediately upgrade to a more recent and supported version of jQuery (preferably 3.6+). Ensure that any old, deprecated versions are removed.
    - **Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP header to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

---

#### **5. Exposed WordPress REST API Endpoints (wp-json)**

- **Issue:** WordPress REST API endpoints may expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to private data.
    - **Potential Exploitation:**
        - **User Enumeration:** The REST API may reveal a list of registered users through the `/wp-json/wp/v2/users` endpoint, allowing attackers to enumerate users.
        - **Access to Private Content:** Exposed endpoints could allow attackers to retrieve drafts, private posts, or other restricted content if not properly secured.
- **Recommendation:**
    - **Secure REST API:** Ensure that REST API endpoints are properly secured using authentication and authorization checks.
    - **Limit User Data Exposure:** Avoid exposing user data, like usernames or emails, unless necessary. Implement user role-based access control.
    - **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints:** Disable any unnecessary endpoints or restrict their exposure based on the use case.

---

#### **6. Network Information from Nmap Scan**

- **Open Ports:**
    - **FTP (21/tcp):** The server is running Pure-FTPd, which is commonly used for file transfers but can also be a vector for unauthorized file access or data leakage.
    - **HTTP (80/tcp), HTTPS (443/tcp):** The website is accessible over HTTP and HTTPS, both hosted on Nginx.
    - **IMAP/POP3 (110/143/993/tcp):** Dovecot is used for email services, which could expose sensitive email content if not properly configured.
    - **SMTP (465/587/tcp):** Exim SMTPD allows for email handling but may also be used for spam if not properly secured.
- **Recommendation:**
    - **Harden FTP:** Restrict FTP access to trusted IPs, and consider disabling it if it's not necessary for the site's operation. Use secure FTP (SFTP) if needed.
    - **Email Services Security:** Ensure that email services (SMTP, IMAP) are securely configured, using TLS/SSL and strong authentication mechanisms to prevent abuse.

---

#### **7. SSL/TLS and Security Configurations**

- **Issue:** SSL/TLS configurations may not be optimized to defend against modern attacks like POODLE, BEAST, or others.
- **Recommendation:**
    - **Review SSL Configurations:** Check SSL/TLS settings for weak ciphers and SSL versions. Use tools like `ssltest` from Qualys to test SSL/TLS configurations.
    - **Enable HSTS:** Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force clients to always connect over HTTPS and prevent SSL stripping attacks.
    - **Use Strong SSL/TLS Versions:** Disable outdated protocols like SSL 2.0/3.0 and use TLS 1.2 or higher.

---

### **Final Conclusion:**

The website **motif.com.np** presents multiple security risks, including exposed directories, outdated plugins, vulnerable jQuery versions, and unprotected REST API endpoints. Immediate action is required to secure the server and application to prevent potential attacks. Regular vulnerability scans and updates to plugins and software, along with proper configuration and access controls, will help mitigate these risks.
