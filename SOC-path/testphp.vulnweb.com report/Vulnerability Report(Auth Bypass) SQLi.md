# Title:
- SQLi vulnerability that allows Auth Bypass in Login Page on http://testphp.vulnweb.com/

# Summary:

- In the login page->username field , even though the test->test login creds were given, using a certain payload can help bypass login without the password.

- After going to Your Profile page, we find that test's real name is John M Smith.

# Target:
[`http://testphp.vulnweb.com/`]


# Steps to Reproduce:

1. In the Login page, you can see that test->test login creds is given for testing.
2. But you can bypass the login as test without even needing the password.
3. use the payload `test--` in the `username` field and leave the `password` field empty, to see you can successfully login.

# Proof of Concept(PoC)

# Impact:

- Identity theft, Sensitive Information leakage, lack of privacy

# Recommended Mitigation:

- While using the payload, it is found that the application uses MySQL, so , since it is a php web application, parameterizing the queries in the code can help prevent this SQLi.

# Severity: High -> Critical
