# Title:
- Reflected XSS found on http://testphp.vulnweb.com/
# Summary:

- in the search bar, the searched keyword is reflected on the site, which makes it vulnerable for reflected XSS.

# Target:
[`http://testphp.vulnweb.com/`]

# Steps to Reproduce:

1. In the search bar, searched the keyword `hello`, which then gets reflected in the side.
2. Searched `<script>alert(1)</script>` in the search bar, which then triggers the reflected XSS.
3. Searched `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` , which also triggers the XSS, but shows blank alert.

# Proof of Concept(PoC):

- In the search bar, Type in `<script>alert(1)</script>`


# Impact:

- Can be used to exfiltrate cookie and sessions for CSRF.

# Recommended Mitigation:

- Since this is a PHP application, the search parameter/keyword should be well sanitized using `htmlspecialchars()` function.

# Severity: Medium to High
