# Title: 
- Stored XSS found on http://testphp.vulnweb.com/

# Summary;

- in the guestbook, where you can store notes, if injected a malicious JS script, it gets stored, and triggers.

# Target:
http://testphp.vulnweb.com/

# Steps to Reproduce:

1. In the guestbook text field, add a message, `<h1>test</h1>`, and then see that test is now stored as `h1` tag.
2. With that, you can inject normal `<script>alert(1)</script>`
3. But we need a payload that executes on load, so try `<svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>`

# Proof of Concept(PoC):

# Impact

- Can be used to stored malicious scripts which can load without the other end users noticing, hindering their privacy.


# Recommended Mitigation

- Escape the input properly with `htmlspecialchars()`

# Severity: Medium to High
